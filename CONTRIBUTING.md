## Guidelines

- **Keep pull requests focused:** Each PR should address a single concern or feature.
- **Write clear commit messages:** Explain why the change is needed â€” use the [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for commit messages. CI will not pass if the commit format is incorrect.
- **Add or update documentation:** If your change affects usage or APIs, update the appropriate documentation.
- **Add tests:** Cover new features or bug fixes with tests whenever possible. Each feature or bug fix should have corresponding tests for better maintainability.
- **Be respectful and constructive:** Treat others with courtesy and aim for positive, helpful collaboration in code reviews and discussions.

## Automated Checks

- The automated commit format check will run before each commit. If it doesn't pass, please correct your commit format and try again.
- The CI checks will run on each pull request to verify code style, linting, and tests. Please make sure all checks pass before requesting a review.
